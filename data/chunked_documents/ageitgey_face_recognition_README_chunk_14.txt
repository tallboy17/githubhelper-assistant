* Many, many thanks to Davis King (@nulhom)
for creating dlib and for providing the trained facial feature detection and face encoding models
used in this library. For more information on the ResNet that powers the face encodings, check out
his blog post.
* Thanks to everyone who works on all the awesome Python data science libraries like numpy, scipy, scikit-image,
pillow, etc, etc that makes this kind of stuff so easy and fun in Python.
* Thanks to Cookiecutter and the
audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage project template
for making Python project packaging way more tolerable.
