- gpt-engineer installs the binary 'bench', which gives you a simple interface for benchmarking your own agent implementations against popular public datasets.
- The easiest way to get started with benchmarking is by checking out the template repo, which contains detailed instructions and an agent template.
- Currently supported benchmark:
- APPS
- MBPP  
The community has started work with different benchmarking initiatives, as described in this Loom video.
