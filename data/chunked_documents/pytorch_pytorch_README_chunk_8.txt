Writing new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch's Tensor API was designed to be straightforward
and with minimal abstractions.  
You can write new neural network layers in Python using the torch API
or your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy.  
If you want to write your layers in C/C++, we provide a convenient extension API that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate.
No wrapper code needs to be written. You can see a tutorial here and an example here.
