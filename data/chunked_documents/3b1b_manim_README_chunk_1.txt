Manim is an engine for precise programmatic animations, designed for creating explanatory math videos.  
Note, there are two versions of manim.  This repository began as a personal project by the author of 3Blue1Brown for the purpose of animating those videos, with video-specific code available here.  In 2020 a group of developers forked it into what is now the community edition, with a goal of being more stable, better tested, quicker to respond to community contributions, and all around friendlier to get started with. See this page for more details.
