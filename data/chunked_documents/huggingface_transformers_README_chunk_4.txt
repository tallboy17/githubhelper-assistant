Header 2: Why should I use Transformers?
---
1. Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:
- High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, audio, video, and multimodal tasks.
- Low barrier to entry for researchers, engineers, and developers.
- Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.
- A unified API for using all our pretrained models.  
1. Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:
- Share trained models instead of training from scratch.
- Reduce compute time and production costs.
- Dozens of model architectures with 1M+ pretrained checkpoints across all modalities.  
1. Choose the right framework for every part of a models lifetime:
- Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.
- Move a single model between PyTorch/JAX/TF2.0 frameworks at will.
- Pick the right framework for training, evaluation, and production.  
1. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:
- We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors.
- Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible.
- Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.
