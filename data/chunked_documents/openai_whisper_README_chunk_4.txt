There are six model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs.
Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model.
The relative speeds below are measured by transcribing English speech on a A100, and the real-world speed may vary significantly depending on many factors including the language, the speaking speed, and the available hardware.  
|  Size  | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model | Required VRAM | Relative speed |
|:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  tiny  |    39 M    |     `tiny.en`      |       `tiny`       |     ~1 GB     |      ~10x      |
|  base  |    74 M    |     `base.en`      |       `base`       |     ~1 GB     |      ~7x       |
| small  |   244 M    |     `small.en`     |      `small`       |     ~2 GB     |      ~4x       |
| medium |   769 M    |    `medium.en`     |      `medium`      |     ~5 GB     |      ~2x       |
| large  |   1550 M   |        N/A         |      `large`       |    ~10 GB     |       1x       |
| turbo  |   809 M    |        N/A         |      `turbo`       |     ~6 GB     |      ~8x       |  
The `.en` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the `tiny.en` and `base.en` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the `small.en` and `medium.en` models.
Additionally, the `turbo` model is an optimized version of `large-v3` that offers faster transcription speed with a minimal degradation in accuracy.  
Whisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of `large-v3` and `large-v2` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in *Italic*) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets. Additional WER/CER metrics corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D.1, D.2, and D.4 of the paper, as well as the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores for translation in Appendix D.3.
