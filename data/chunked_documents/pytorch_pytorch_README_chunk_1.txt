!PyTorch Logo  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:
- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system  
You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.  
Our trunk health (Continuous Integration signals) can be found at hud.pytorch.org.
