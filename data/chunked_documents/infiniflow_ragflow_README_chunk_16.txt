Header 3: Switch doc engine from Elasticsearch to Infinity
---
RAGFlow uses Elasticsearch by default for storing full text and vectors. To switch to Infinity, follow these steps:  
1. Stop all running containers:  
```bash
$ docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
```  
> [!WARNING]
> `-v` will delete the docker container volumes, and the existing data will be cleared.  
2. Set `DOC_ENGINE` in **docker/.env** to `infinity`.  
3. Start the containers:  
```bash
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```  
> [!WARNING]
> Switching to Infinity on a Linux/arm64 machine is not yet officially supported.
