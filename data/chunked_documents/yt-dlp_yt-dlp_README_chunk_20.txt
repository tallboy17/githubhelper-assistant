Header 1: USAGE AND OPTIONS
Header 2: Download Options:
---
-N, --concurrent-fragments N    Number of fragments of a dash/hlsnative
video that should be downloaded concurrently
(default is 1)
-r, --limit-rate RATE           Maximum download rate in bytes per second,
e.g. 50K or 4.2M
--throttled-rate RATE           Minimum download rate in bytes per second
below which throttling is assumed and the
video data is re-extracted, e.g. 100K
-R, --retries RETRIES           Number of retries (default is 10), or
"infinite"
--file-access-retries RETRIES   Number of times to retry on file access
error (default is 3), or "infinite"
--fragment-retries RETRIES      Number of retries for a fragment (default is
10), or "infinite" (DASH, hlsnative and ISM)
--retry-sleep [TYPE:]EXPR       Time to sleep between retries in seconds
(optionally) prefixed by the type of retry
(http (default), fragment, file_access,
extractor) to apply the sleep to. EXPR can
be a number, linear=START[:END[:STEP=1]] or
exp=START[:END[:BASE=2]]. This option can be
used multiple times to set the sleep for the
different retry types, e.g. --retry-sleep
linear=1::2 --retry-sleep fragment:exp=1:20
--skip-unavailable-fragments    Skip unavailable fragments for DASH,
hlsnative and ISM downloads (default)
(Alias: --no-abort-on-unavailable-fragments)
--abort-on-unavailable-fragments
Abort download if a fragment is unavailable
(Alias: --no-skip-unavailable-fragments)
--keep-fragments                Keep downloaded fragments on disk after
downloading is finished
--no-keep-fragments             Delete downloaded fragments after
downloading is finished (default)
--buffer-size SIZE              Size of download buffer, e.g. 1024 or 16K
(default is 1024)
--resize-buffer                 The buffer size is automatically resized
from an initial value of --buffer-size
(default)
--no-resize-buffer              Do not automatically adjust the buffer size
--http-chunk-size SIZE          Size of a chunk for chunk-based HTTP
downloading, e.g. 10485760 or 10M (default
is disabled). May be useful for bypassing
bandwidth throttling imposed by a webserver
(experimental)
--playlist-random               Download playlist videos in random order
--lazy-playlist                 Process entries in the playlist as they are
received. This disables n_entries,
--playlist-random and --playlist-reverse
--no-lazy-playlist              Process videos in the playlist only after
the entire playlist is parsed (default)
--xattr-set-filesize            Set file xattribute ytdl.filesize with
expected file size
--hls-use-mpegts                Use the mpegts container for HLS videos;
allowing some players to play the video
while downloading, and reducing the chance
of file corruption if download is
interrupted. This is enabled by default for
live streams
--no-hls-use-mpegts             Do not use the mpegts container for HLS
videos. This is default when not downloading
live streams
--download-sections REGEX       Download only chapters that match the
regular expression. A "*" prefix denotes
time-range instead of chapter. Negative
timestamps are calculated from the end.
"*from-url" can be used to download between
the "start_time" and "end_time" extracted
from the URL. Needs ffmpeg. This option can
be used multiple times to download multiple
sections, e.g. --download-sections
"*10:15-inf" --download-sections "intro"
--downloader [PROTO:]NAME       Name or path of the external downloader to
use (optionally) prefixed by the protocols
(http, ftp, m3u8, dash, rstp, rtmp, mms) to
use it for. Currently supports native,
aria2c, avconv, axel, curl, ffmpeg, httpie,
wget. You can use this option multiple times
to set different downloaders for different
protocols. E.g. --downloader aria2c
--downloader "dash,m3u8:native" will use
aria2c for http/ftp downloads, and the
native downloader for dash/m3u8 downloads
(Alias: --external-downloader)
--downloader-args NAME:ARGS     Give these arguments to the external
downloader. Specify the downloader name and
the arguments separated by a colon ":". For
ffmpeg, arguments can be passed to different
positions using the same syntax as
--postprocessor-args. You can use this
option multiple times to give different
arguments to different downloaders (Alias:
--external-downloader-args)
