* YCML - A Machine Learning framework for Objective-C and Swift (OS X / iOS).
* MLPNeuralNet - Fast multilayer perceptron neural network library for iOS and Mac OS X. MLPNeuralNet predicts new examples by trained neural networks. It is built on top of the Apple's Accelerate Framework, using vectorized operations and hardware acceleration if available. **[Deprecated]**
* MAChineLearning - An Objective-C multilayer perceptron library, with full support for training through backpropagation. Implemented using vDSP and vecLib, it's 20 times faster than its Java equivalent. Includes sample code for use from Swift.
* BPN-NeuralNetwork - It implemented 3 layers of neural networks ( Input Layer, Hidden Layer and Output Layer ) and it was named Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPN). This network can be used in products recommendation, user behavior analysis, data mining and data analysis. **[Deprecated]**
* Multi-Perceptron-NeuralNetwork - It implemented multi-perceptrons neural network (ニューラルネットワーク) based on Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPN) and designed unlimited-hidden-layers.
* KRHebbian-Algorithm - It is a non-supervisory and self-learning algorithm (adjust the weights) in the neural network of Machine Learning. **[Deprecated]**
* KRKmeans-Algorithm - It implemented K-Means  clustering and classification algorithm. It could be used in data mining and image compression. **[Deprecated]**
* KRFuzzyCMeans-Algorithm - It implemented Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) the fuzzy clustering / classification algorithm on Machine Learning. It could be used in data mining and image compression. **[Deprecated]**
