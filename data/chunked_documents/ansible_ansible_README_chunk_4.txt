You can install a released version of Ansible with `pip` or a package manager. See our
installation guide for details on installing Ansible
on a variety of platforms.  
Power users and developers can run the `devel` branch, which has the latest
features and fixes, directly. Although it is reasonably stable, you are more likely to encounter
breaking changes when running the `devel` branch. We recommend getting involved
in the Ansible community if you want to run the `devel` branch.
