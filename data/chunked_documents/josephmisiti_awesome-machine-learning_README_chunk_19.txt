#### General-Purpose Machine Learning  
* Torch7
* cephes - Cephes mathematical functions library, wrapped for Torch. Provides and wraps the 180+ special mathematical functions from the Cephes mathematical library, developed by Stephen L. Moshier. It is used, among many other places, at the heart of SciPy. **[Deprecated]**
* autograd - Autograd automatically differentiates native Torch code. Inspired by the original Python version.
* graph - Graph package for Torch. **[Deprecated]**
* randomkit - Numpy's randomkit, wrapped for Torch. **[Deprecated]**
* signal - A signal processing toolbox for Torch-7. FFT, DCT, Hilbert, cepstrums, stft.
* nn - Neural Network package for Torch.
* torchnet - framework for torch which provides a set of abstractions aiming at encouraging code re-use as well as encouraging modular programming.
* nngraph - This package provides graphical computation for nn library in Torch7.
* nnx - A completely unstable and experimental package that extends Torch's builtin nn library.
* rnn - A Recurrent Neural Network library that extends Torch's nn. RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, BRNNs, BLSTMs, etc.
* dpnn - Many useful features that aren't part of the main nn package.
* dp - A deep learning library designed for streamlining research and development using the Torch7 distribution. It emphasizes flexibility through the elegant use of object-oriented design patterns. **[Deprecated]**
* optim - An optimization library for Torch. SGD, Adagrad, Conjugate-Gradient, LBFGS, RProp and more.
* unsup - A package for unsupervised learning in Torch. Provides modules that are compatible with nn (LinearPsd, ConvPsd, AutoEncoder, ...), and self-contained algorithms (k-means, PCA). **[Deprecated]**
* manifold - A package to manipulate manifolds.
* svm - Torch-SVM library. **[Deprecated]**
* lbfgs - FFI Wrapper for liblbfgs. **[Deprecated]**
* vowpalwabbit - An old vowpalwabbit interface to torch. **[Deprecated]**
* OpenGM - OpenGM is a C++ library for graphical modelling, and inference. The Lua bindings provide a simple way of describing graphs, from Lua, and then optimizing them with OpenGM. **[Deprecated]**
* spaghetti - Spaghetti (sparse linear) module for torch7 by @MichaelMathieu **[Deprecated]**
* LuaSHKit - A Lua wrapper around the Locality sensitive hashing library SHKit **[Deprecated]**
* kernel smoothing - KNN, kernel-weighted average, local linear regression smoothers. **[Deprecated]**
* cutorch - Torch CUDA Implementation.
* cunn - Torch CUDA Neural Network Implementation.
* imgraph - An image/graph library for Torch. This package provides routines to construct graphs on images, segment them, build trees out of them, and convert them back to images. **[Deprecated]**
* videograph - A video/graph library for Torch. This package provides routines to construct graphs on videos, segment them, build trees out of them, and convert them back to videos. **[Deprecated]**
* saliency - code and tools around integral images. A library for finding interest points based on fast integral histograms. **[Deprecated]**
* stitch - allows us to use hugin to stitch images and apply same stitching to a video sequence. **[Deprecated]**
* sfm - A bundle adjustment/structure from motion package. **[Deprecated]**
* fex - A package for feature extraction in Torch. Provides SIFT and dSIFT modules. **[Deprecated]**
* OverFeat - A state-of-the-art generic dense feature extractor. **[Deprecated]**
* wav2letter - a simple and efficient end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system from Facebook AI Research.
* Numeric Lua
* Lunatic Python
* SciLua
* Lua - Numerical Algorithms **[Deprecated]**
* Lunum **[Deprecated]**
* Keras GPT Copilot - A python package that integrates an LLM copilot inside the keras model development workflow.
