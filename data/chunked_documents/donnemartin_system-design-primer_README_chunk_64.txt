Header 3: Load balancer vs reverse proxy
---
* Deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers.  Often, load balancers  route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.
* Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server, opening up the benefits described in the previous section.
* Solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.
