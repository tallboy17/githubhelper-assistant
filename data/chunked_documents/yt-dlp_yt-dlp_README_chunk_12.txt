You will need the build tools `python` (3.9+), `zip`, `make` (GNU), `pandoc`\* and `pytest`\*.  
After installing these, simply run `make`.  
You can also run `make yt-dlp` instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (The build tools marked with **\*** are not needed for this)
