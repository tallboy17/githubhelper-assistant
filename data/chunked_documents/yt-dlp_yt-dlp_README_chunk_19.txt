-I, --playlist-items ITEM_SPEC  Comma separated playlist_index of the items
to download. You can specify a range using
"[START]:[STOP][:STEP]". For backward
compatibility, START-STOP is also supported.
Use negative indices to count from the right
and negative STEP to download in reverse
order. E.g. "-I 1:3,7,-5::2" used on a
playlist of size 15 will download the items
at index 1,2,3,7,11,13,15
--min-filesize SIZE             Abort download if filesize is smaller than
SIZE, e.g. 50k or 44.6M
--max-filesize SIZE             Abort download if filesize is larger than
SIZE, e.g. 50k or 44.6M
--date DATE                     Download only videos uploaded on this date.
The date can be "YYYYMMDD" or in the format
[now|today|yesterday][-N[day|week|month|year]].
E.g. "--date today-2weeks" downloads only
videos uploaded on the same day two weeks ago
--datebefore DATE               Download only videos uploaded on or before
this date. The date formats accepted are the
same as --date
--dateafter DATE                Download only videos uploaded on or after
this date. The date formats accepted are the
same as --date
--match-filters FILTER          Generic video filter. Any "OUTPUT TEMPLATE"
field can be compared with a number or a
string using the operators defined in
"Filtering Formats". You can also simply
specify a field to match if the field is
present, use "!field" to check if the field
is not present, and "&" to check multiple
conditions. Use a "\" to escape "&" or
quotes if needed. If used multiple times,
the filter matches if at least one of the
conditions is met. E.g. --match-filters
!is_live --match-filters "like_count>?100 &
description~='(?i)\bcats \& dogs\b'" matches
only videos that are not live OR those that
have a like count more than 100 (or the like
field is not available) and also has a
description that contains the phrase "cats &
dogs" (caseless). Use "--match-filters -" to
interactively ask whether to download each
video

--break-match-filters FILTER    Same as "--match-filters" but stops the
