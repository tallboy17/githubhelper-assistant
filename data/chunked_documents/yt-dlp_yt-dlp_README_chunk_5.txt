Python versions 3.9+ (CPython) and 3.10+ (PyPy) are supported. Other versions and implementations may or may not work correctly.  

On Windows, Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86) is also necessary to run yt-dlp. You probably already have this, but if the executable throws an error due to missing `MSVCR100.dll` you need to install it manually.

While all the other dependencies are optional, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are highly recommended
