All the examples are available here.  
#### Face Detection  
* Find faces in a photograph
* Find faces in a photograph (using deep learning)
* Find faces in batches of images w/ GPU (using deep learning)
* Blur all the faces in a live video using your webcam (Requires OpenCV to be installed)  
#### Facial Features  
* Identify specific facial features in a photograph
* Apply (horribly ugly) digital make-up  
#### Facial Recognition  
* Find and recognize unknown faces in a photograph based on photographs of known people
* Identify and draw boxes around each person in a photo
* Compare faces by numeric face distance instead of only True/False matches
* Recognize faces in live video using your webcam - Simple / Slower Version (Requires OpenCV to be installed)
* Recognize faces in live video using your webcam - Faster Version (Requires OpenCV to be installed)
* Recognize faces in a video file and write out new video file (Requires OpenCV to be installed)
* Recognize faces on a Raspberry Pi w/ camera
* Run a web service to recognize faces via HTTP (Requires Flask to be installed)
* Recognize faces with a K-nearest neighbors classifier
* Train multiple images per person then recognize faces using a SVM
