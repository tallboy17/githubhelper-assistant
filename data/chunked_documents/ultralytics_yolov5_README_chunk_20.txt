Ultralytics provides two licensing options to meet different needs:  
- **AGPL-3.0 License**: An OSI-approved open-source license ideal for academic research, personal projects, and testing. It promotes open collaboration and knowledge sharing. See the LICENSE file for details.
- **Enterprise License**: Tailored for commercial applications, this license allows seamless integration of Ultralytics software and AI models into commercial products and services, bypassing the open-source requirements of AGPL-3.0. For commercial use cases, please contact us via Ultralytics Licensing.
