Explain Object Storage  
- Data is divided to self-contained objects
- Objects can contain metadata
  

What are the pros and cons of object storage?  
Pros:
- Usually with object storage, you pay for what you use as opposed to other storage types where you pay for the storage space you allocate
- Scalable storage: Object storage mostly based on a model where what you use, is what you get and you can add storage as need
Cons:
- Usually performs slower than other types of storage
- No granular modification: to change an object, you have re-create it
