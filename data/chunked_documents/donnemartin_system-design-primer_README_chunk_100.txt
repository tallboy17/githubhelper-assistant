This section could use some updates.  Consider contributing!  
Security is a broad topic.  Unless you have considerable experience, a security background, or are applying for a position that requires knowledge of security, you probably won't need to know more than the basics:  
* Encrypt in transit and at rest.
* Sanitize all user inputs or any input parameters exposed to user to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
* Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
* Use the principle of least privilege.
