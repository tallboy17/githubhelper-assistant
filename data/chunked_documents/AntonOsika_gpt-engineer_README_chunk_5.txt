- Locate a folder with code which you want to improve anywhere on your computer
- Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions for how you want to improve the code
- Run `gpte  -i` with a relative path to your folder
- For example: `gpte projects/my-old-project -i` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your folder in `projects/`
