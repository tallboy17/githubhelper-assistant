The new frontend is now the default for ComfyUI. However, please note:  
1. The frontend in the main ComfyUI repository is updated fortnightly.
2. Daily releases are available in the separate frontend repository.  
To use the most up-to-date frontend version:  
1. For the latest daily release, launch ComfyUI with this command line argument:  
```
--front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@latest
```  
2. For a specific version, replace `latest` with the desired version number:  
```
--front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@1.2.2
```  
This approach allows you to easily switch between the stable fortnightly release and the cutting-edge daily updates, or even specific versions for testing purposes.
