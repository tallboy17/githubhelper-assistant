If you have trouble with downloading models and datasets from Hugging Face, you can use ModelScope.  
```bash
export USE_MODELSCOPE_HUB=1 # `set USE_MODELSCOPE_HUB=1` for Windows
```  
Train the model by specifying a model ID of the ModelScope Hub as the `model_name_or_path`. You can find a full list of model IDs at ModelScope Hub, e.g., `LLM-Research/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct`.
