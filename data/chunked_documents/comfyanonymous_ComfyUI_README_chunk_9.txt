Simply download, extract with 7-Zip and run. Make sure you put your Stable Diffusion checkpoints/models (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: ComfyUI\models\checkpoints  
If you have trouble extracting it, right click the file -> properties -> unblock  
#### How do I share models between another UI and ComfyUI?  
See the Config file to set the search paths for models. In the standalone windows build you can find this file in the ComfyUI directory. Rename this file to extra_model_paths.yaml and edit it with your favorite text editor.
