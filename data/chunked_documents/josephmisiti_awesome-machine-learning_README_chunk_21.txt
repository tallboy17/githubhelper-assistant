#### Computer Vision  
* OpenCVDotNet - A wrapper for the OpenCV project to be used with .NET applications.
* Emgu CV - Cross platform wrapper of OpenCV which can be compiled in Mono to be run on Windows, Linus, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android.
* AForge.NET - Open source C# framework for developers and researchers in the fields of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. Development has now shifted to GitHub.
* Accord.NET - Together with AForge.NET, this library can provide image processing and computer vision algorithms to Windows, Windows RT and Windows Phone. Some components are also available for Java and Android.  

#### Natural Language Processing  
* Stanford.NLP for .NET - A full port of Stanford NLP packages to .NET and also available precompiled as a NuGet package.  

#### General-Purpose Machine Learning  
* Accord-Framework -The Accord.NET Framework is a complete framework for building machine learning, computer vision, computer audition, signal processing and statistical applications.
* Accord.MachineLearning - Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Naive Bayesian models, K-means, Gaussian Mixture models and general algorithms such as Ransac, Cross-validation and Grid-Search for machine-learning applications. This package is part of the Accord.NET Framework.
* DiffSharp - An automatic differentiation (AD) library providing exact and efficient derivatives (gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, directional derivatives, and matrix-free Hessian- and Jacobian-vector products) for machine learning and optimization applications. Operations can be nested to any level, meaning that you can compute exact higher-order derivatives and differentiate functions that are internally making use of differentiation, for applications such as hyperparameter optimization.
* Encog - An advanced neural network and machine learning framework. Encog contains classes to create a wide variety of networks, as well as support classes to normalize and process data for these neural networks. Encog trains using multithreaded resilient propagation. Encog can also make use of a GPU to further speed processing time. A GUI based workbench is also provided to help model and train neural networks.
* GeneticSharp - Multi-platform genetic algorithm library for .NET Core and .NET Framework. The library has several implementations of GA operators, like: selection, crossover, mutation, reinsertion and termination.
* Infer.NET - Infer.NET is a framework for running Bayesian inference in graphical models. One can use Infer.NET to solve many different kinds of machine learning problems, from standard problems like classification, recommendation or clustering through customized solutions to domain-specific problems. Infer.NET has been used in a wide variety of domains including information retrieval, bioinformatics, epidemiology, vision, and many others.
* ML.NET - ML.NET is a cross-platform open-source machine learning framework which makes machine learning accessible to .NET developers. ML.NET was originally developed in Microsoft Research and evolved into a significant framework over the last decade and is used across many product groups in Microsoft like Windows, Bing, PowerPoint, Excel and more.
* Neural Network Designer - DBMS management system and designer for neural networks. The designer application is developed using WPF, and is a user interface which allows you to design your neural network, query the network, create and configure chat bots that are capable of asking questions and learning from your feedback. The chat bots can even scrape the internet for information to return in their output as well as to use for learning.
* Synapses - Neural network library in F#.
* Vulpes - Deep belief and deep learning implementation written in F# and leverages CUDA GPU execution with Alea.cuBase.
* MxNet.Sharp - .NET Standard bindings for Apache MxNet with Imperative, Symbolic and Gluon Interface for developing, training and deploying Machine Learning models in C#.   

#### Data Analysis / Data Visualization  
* numl - numl is a machine learning library intended to ease the use of using standard modelling techniques for both prediction and clustering.
* Math.NET Numerics - Numerical foundation of the Math.NET project, aiming to provide methods and algorithms for numerical computations in science, engineering and everyday use. Supports .Net 4.0, .Net 3.5 and Mono on Windows, Linux and Mac; Silverlight 5, WindowsPhone/SL 8, WindowsPhone 8.1 and Windows 8 with PCL Portable Profiles 47 and 344; Android/iOS with Xamarin.
* Sho - Sho is an interactive environment for data analysis and scientific computing that lets you seamlessly connect scripts (in IronPython) with compiled code (in .NET) to enable fast and flexible prototyping. The environment includes powerful and efficient libraries for linear algebra as well as data visualization that can be used from any .NET language, as well as a feature-rich interactive shell for rapid development.
