Header 3: Step 4: Scale the design
---
Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?  
* Load balancer
* Horizontal scaling
* Caching
* Database sharding  
Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using principles of scalable system design.
