#### General-Purpose Machine Learning
* Darknet - Darknet is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It is fast, easy to install, and supports CPU and GPU computation.
* Recommender - A C library for product recommendations/suggestions using collaborative filtering (CF).
* Hybrid Recommender System - A hybrid recommender system based upon scikit-learn algorithms. **[Deprecated]**
* neonrvm - neonrvm is an open source machine learning library based on RVM technique. It's written in C programming language and comes with Python programming language bindings.
* cONNXr - An `ONNX` runtime written in pure C (99) with zero dependencies focused on small embedded devices. Run inference on your machine learning models no matter which framework you train it with. Easy to install and compiles everywhere, even in very old devices.
* libonnx - A lightweight, portable pure C99 onnx inference engine for embedded devices with hardware acceleration support.  

#### Computer Vision  
* CCV - C-based/Cached/Core Computer Vision Library, A Modern Computer Vision Library.
* VLFeat - VLFeat is an open and portable library of computer vision algorithms, which has a Matlab toolbox.
