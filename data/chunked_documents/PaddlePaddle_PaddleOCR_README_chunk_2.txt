Since its initial release, PaddleOCR has gained widespread acclaim across academia, industry, and research communities, thanks to its cutting-edge algorithms and proven performance in real-world applications. It's already powering popular open-source projects like Umi-OCR, OmniParser, MinerU, and RAGFlow, making it the go-to OCR toolkit for developers worldwide.  
On May 20, 2025, the PaddlePaddle team unveiled PaddleOCR 3.0, fully compatible with the official release of the **PaddlePaddle 3.0** framework. This update further **boosts text-recognition accuracy**, adds support for **multiple text-type recognition** and **handwriting recognition**, and meets the growing demand from large-model applications for **high-precision parsing of complex documents**. When combined with the **ERNIE 4.5 Turbo**, it significantly enhances key-information extraction accuracy. PaddleOCR 3.0 also introduces support for Chinese Heterogeneous AI Accelerators such as **KUNLUNXIN** and **Ascend**. For the complete usage documentation, please refer to the PaddleOCR 3.0 Documentation.  
Three Major New Features in PaddleOCR 3.0:
- Universal-Scene Text Recognition Model PP-OCRv5: A single model that handles five different text types plus complex handwriting. Overall recognition accuracy has increased by 13 percentage points over the previous generation. Online Demo  
- General Document-Parsing Solution PP-StructureV3: Delivers high-precision parsing of multi-layout, multi-scene PDFs, outperforming many open- and closed-source solutions on public benchmarks. Online Demo  
- Intelligent Document-Understanding Solution PP-ChatOCRv4: Natively powered by the ERNIE 4.5 Turbo, achieving 15 percentage points higher accuracy than its predecessor. Online Demo  
In addition to providing an outstanding model library, PaddleOCR 3.0 also offers user-friendly tools covering model training, inference, and service deployment, so developers can rapidly bring AI applications to production.
