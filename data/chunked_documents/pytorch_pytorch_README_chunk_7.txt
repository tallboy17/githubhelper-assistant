PyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration libraries
such as Intel MKL and NVIDIA (cuDNN, NCCL) to maximize speed.
At the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends
are mature and have been tested for years.  
Hence, PyTorch is quite fast â€” whether you run small or large neural networks.  
The memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.
We've written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure that
your deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.
This enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.
