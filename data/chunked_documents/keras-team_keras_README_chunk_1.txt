Header 1: Keras 3: Deep Learning for Humans
---
Keras 3 is a multi-backend deep learning framework, with support for JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenVINO (for inference-only).
Effortlessly build and train models for computer vision, natural language processing, audio processing,
timeseries forecasting, recommender systems, etc.  
- **Accelerated model development**: Ship deep learning solutions faster thanks to the high-level UX of Keras
and the availability of easy-to-debug runtimes like PyTorch or JAX eager execution.
- **State-of-the-art performance**: By picking the backend that is the fastest for your model architecture (often JAX!),
leverage speedups ranging from 20% to 350% compared to other frameworks. Benchmark here.
- **Datacenter-scale training**: Scale confidently from your laptop to large clusters of GPUs or TPUs.  
Join nearly three million developers, from burgeoning startups to global enterprises, in harnessing the power of Keras 3.
