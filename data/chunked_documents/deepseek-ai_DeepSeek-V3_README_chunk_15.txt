LightLLM v1.0.1 supports single-machine and multi-machine tensor parallel deployment for DeepSeek-R1 (FP8/BF16) and provides mixed-precision deployment, with more quantization modes continuously integrated. For more details, please refer to LightLLM instructions. Additionally, LightLLM offers PD-disaggregation deployment for DeepSeek-V2, and the implementation of PD-disaggregation for DeepSeek-V3 is in development.
