For playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading `LibriSpeech/train-clean-100`. Extract the contents as `/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100` where `` is a directory of your choosing. Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see here. You're free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.
