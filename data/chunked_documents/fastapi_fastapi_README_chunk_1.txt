FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.  
The key features are:  
* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.  
* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications.
