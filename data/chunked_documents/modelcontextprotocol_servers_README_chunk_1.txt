Header 1: Model Context Protocol servers
---
This repository is a collection of *reference implementations* for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), as well as references
to community built servers and additional resources.  
The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.
Typically, each MCP server is implemented with an MCP SDK:
- C# MCP SDK
- Java MCP SDK
- Kotlin MCP SDK
- Python MCP SDK
- Typescript MCP SDK
